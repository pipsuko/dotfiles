#: Fonts {{{

#: kitty has very powerful font management. You can configure
#: individual font faces and even specify special fonts for particular
#: characters.

 font_family      GoMono Nerd Font Mono
 bold_font        GoMono Nerd Font Mono Bold
 italic_font      auto
 bold_italic_font auto

#: You can specify different fonts for the bold/italic/bold-italic
#: variants. To get a full list of supported fonts use the `kitty
#: +list-fonts` command. By default they are derived automatically, by
#: the OSes font system. When bold_font or bold_italic_font is set to
#: auto on macOS, the priority of bold fonts is semi-bold, bold,
#: heavy. Setting them manually is useful for font families that have
#: many weight variants like Book, Medium, Thick, etc. For example::

#:     font_family      Operator Mono Book
#:     bold_font        Operator Mono Medium
#:     italic_font      Operator Mono Book Italic
#:     bold_italic_font Operator Mono Medium Italic


 font_size 12.0


#: Font size (in pts)

 cursor_shape beam

#: The cursor shape can be one of block, beam, underline. Note that
#: when reloading the config this will be changed only if the cursor
#: shape has not been set by the program running in the terminal. This
#: sets the default cursor shape, applications running in the terminal
#: can override it. In particular, shell integration
#: <https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/shell-integration/> in kitty sets
#: the cursor shape to beam at shell prompts. You can avoid this by
#: setting shell_integration to no-cursor.


#: The foreground and background colors.
